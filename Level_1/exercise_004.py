# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 34,67,55,33,12,98
# Then, the output should be:
# ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
# ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
# tuple() method can convert list to tuple

valores = '2,4,5,6,11,22,55,61'

lista = valores.split(",")

tupla = tuple(lista)

print(lista)
print(tupla)
